# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

A machine learning project designed to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) based on patient health data. This project uses a dataset from Kaggle and applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Model training using multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
[Kaggle - Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)

## Purpose
Developed as a machine learning project to explore how data-driven techniques can assist in early detection and prevention of cardiovascular disease risks.
